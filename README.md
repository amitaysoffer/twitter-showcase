## Summary

This is my first full stack web application. I built this app to learn the complexities of building a web application from top to bottom and to further my knowledge of React and Express.

There was a lot of new experience to gain while building this application and there were many challenges to overcome while building this project. It is important for me to get comfortable with maintaining projects with more complexity and more moving parts. I was very excited to continue to gain experience with React and I am starting to feel very comfortable navigating the React JS framework.
